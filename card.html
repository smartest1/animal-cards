			<p> Lions are known to attack elephants when food is scarce.
					The males are territorial, and will roar and use scent markings to establish their domains.
					Females do almost all of the hunting. They are mainly nocturnal and work in teams to stalk and ambush prey.
					Lions inhabit grassy plains, savannahs, open woodlands and scrub country. A lion’s roar can be heard from as far as 5 miles away.
